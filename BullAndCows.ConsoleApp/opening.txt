The players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are cows, if in different positions, they are bulls. Example:

Secret number: 4271
Opponent's try: 1234
Answer: 1C 2B – one cow ('2') and two bulls ('1' and '4')
